# Math-Quiz
There are nine different tasks to solve. Every task has random numbers and the tasks become more and more difficult. If the player has solved the task correctly, he moves up one level. If the result is wrong, he stays in the same level. The score is saved in the local storage and the corresponding level is visually highlighted with a colour.
